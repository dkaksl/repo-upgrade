# repo-upgrade

CLI tool to automatically implement some improvements in repositories.

## Background

Ever find yourself applying the same settings to many of the repositories you work with? Tired of having different implementations and not everything in place everywhere? Too complicated or not worth it to rebase on a template project? Wish you could just automatically apply the same settings to all of your local repositories? This repository is (WIP) for you.
